# CISC-3140-Lab-7
This is my log of how I created Lab 7
  For this assignment, I created a new java file in the terminal, and compiled it. Then a created a Makefile with 2 recipes. One was the Hello World java file, which would just print a message, and the other was a test resipe that would simply print a message to the terminal.
  Unfortuantely, due to trial and error, the log file I created during these sessions was too large to upload. Instead, I opened the makefile using cat and described my commands as well as using the make function.
